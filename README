This is profillic-hmmer, modified versions of HMMER 3 programs to
implement interoperability with galosh profiles (as generated by
profillic).  Please see the document CITING, which should have been
included with this file.  You may use at will, subject to the license
(GPL v3), but *please cite the relevant papers* in your
documentation and publications associated with uses of this library.
Thank you!

PLATFORMS:

Although profillic has been designed for cross-platform use, the
current version has only been tested on Mac OS X systems.  It should
easily install on any other *nix platform.  If you are on Windows, and
want to compile this, we recommend using Cygwin.  If you are able to
compile this on Windows or elsewhere, please let us know and tell us
what you did to make it happen.  Thanks.

DEPENDENCIES:

profillic relies on a number of other libraries.  All are open source
and are easy to install.

Required external libraries:
---
HMMER v3.0 source code (exactly v3.0; later versions will probably not work):
ftp://selab.janelia.org/pub/software/hmmer3/3.0/hmmer-3.0.tar.gz

BOOST (tested with version 1.47.0 and 1.46.1):
http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.47.0/

Seqan version 1.2 (Note that the most recent version is 1.3 but we
have not yet updated our code to be compatible with the new version,
so you'll have to get version 1.2):
http://www.seqan.de/uploads/media/Seqan_Release_1.2.zip

HMMoC-BFloat-Algebra:
http://pedlefsen.github.com/HMMoC-BFloat-Algebra/

Required galosh libraries:
---
prolific:  http://galosh.github.com/prolific

See the document INSTALL for more information.

Thank you,
