profillicSimulation relies on a number of other libraries.  All are open source
and are easy to install.

Required external libraries:
---
BOOST (tested with version 1.59.0)
Seqan (direct from github)

HMMoC-BFloat-Algebra:
https://github.com/pedlefsen/HMMoC-BFloat-Algebra

Required galosh libraries:
---
prolific (NOT the same thing as "profillic"):  https://github.com/galosh/prolific
profillic (NOT the same thing as "prolific"):  https://github.com/galosh/profillic

Recommended galosh libraries:
---
profuse:  https://github.com/galosh/profuse

### Follows installation instructions for the profillic package, then, do:

git clone https://github.com/tholzman/profillicSimulation.git
cd profillicSimulation
=========
FINALLY, installing profillicSimulation.

ln -s /opt/local/lib boost-lib
ln -s /opt/local/include boost-include
ln -s ~/src/from-git/seqan seqan-trunk
ln -s ../HMMoC-BFloat-Algebra
ln -s ../prolific
ln -s ../profillic

## NOTE: I had to add --toolset=darwin because it wasn't guessing it correctly. You can add eg "use darwin ;" to your site-config.jam [or user-config.jam] file.
# First must make sure you can compile it in the fast-to-compile, slow-to-run "debug" variant, before trying to compile the slow-to-compile "release" variant.
bjam --clean --toolset=darwin
bjam dist release --toolset=darwin
cd ..
# The above will (slowly) compile the executables, and will copy them to the dist/ subdir.

# You might be interested to check out the bjam (Boost.Build) documentation: http://www.boost.org/boost-build2/doc/html/index.html
